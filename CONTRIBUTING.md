### Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome for both bugfixes and new features. I reserve the right not to merge a PR in any case. In all such cases, I will communicate with you on the PR to let you know whether/what changes need to be made to the PR before it can be merged.

* Clearly describe what the pull request does
* Include screenshots or animated GIFs in your pull request when sensible.
* Use [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)! Otherwise, I will ask you to revise your PR.
* When a PR adds or changes a feature, update the documentation as well.

## Styleguides

### Git commit messages

This project now uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for its commit messages. This provides a number of benefits, including better human and machine readability and compliance with the requirements for automatic versioning, which is used in the main branch.

In addition to using conventional commits, please adhere to the following when writing commit messages:

1. Use the present tense in the imperative mood ("Add feature", not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
2. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
3. Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:

```
feat: Add new mapping for buffer navigation
fix: Resolve issue with autocmd not firing
docs: Update installation instructions in README
refactor: Simplify autocommand setup
```
